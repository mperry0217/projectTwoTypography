Project 2, words in motion, Monica Perry

# project overview

This project is meant to communicate the idea of community through poetry/song. My iteration of this project features an unaccredited song, herefore credited to my elementary music teacher Tom Burkett at Redding School of the Arts. It is a campfire song I used to sing in elementary and middle school in canon with all the other students at assembly. It unified us as a community and as musicians/artists, giving us the sense that we were a part of something bigger.

The use of animation through this piece is intended to visualize the feeling of dreaming and community I felt as a child in singing this song.
